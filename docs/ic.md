At its essence, IC is about creating meaning by collecting our thoughts (well techincally our [thots](#Thots), but we'll get to that...)

The whole thing is built on an extremely simple and flexible standard...

```
IC is
+ plain text
+ with a couple simple rules
- complicated
```
That's it. That's the whole idea. The preceding example demonstrates the fundamental concepts of  IC:

* When we encounter a text string formatted like so it represents a single perspective. If we found that in the wild we would assume it represented one person's perceptions.
* the first line- `IC is` - declares that this is the [thot](#Thots) we're about to describe. 
* lines that start with a `+` are like "yes".  In this case, this person thinks `IC is` *is* `plain text`, and from a certain perspective they're right. `+plain text` strengthens the connection between `IC is` and `plain text`. The connection is directional: `plain text` describes `IC is` or you could say that `plain text` is a child of `IC is`.
* a `-` at the beginning of the line is like a "no". `IC is` is "repelling" `complicated`
* notice that the initial thot is `IC is` not `IC`. It could have been with `IC` too, but it's important to keep s moment I chose to keep it more "natural". That's how I ended up writing it and then I hit <enter>. If I'd wanted to compete in/influence the mindspace for `IC` I might have used more strategy

tldr...The easiest way to think about IC is like tagging. Only ur tagging everything, even the tags themselves. 

## Thots

Every new splooge of tech needs a dumb word and this is ours.  But don't worry, this one is actually good cuz it sounds the same but it's spelled different.

`Thots` are just text, but you can think of them like a digital version of thoughts. They are our thoughts when we put them into a computer. Clearly something is lost, but it's so much more *efficient*. When viewed like so, you see that shorter `thots` will be used to tie huge numbers of things together, similar to how we use tags now, only in an open way without the silos.  As `thots` get longer and/or more idiosyncratic, *and* as the collections of `thots` grow, they can be used to connect like minds, or maybe create new ones.

Because `thots` are just text *and* so much other stuff online is also just text, `thots` can also represent those online things. For example:

* `@owise1` can be assumed to be a social media handle of some kind. at least these days.
* `/ipfs/QmckHbjMQTww8UaruK8HMxGv9aMGyx2ynFggqg6wQqs19i` can be assumed to be a file of some kind
* `https://web.archive.org/web/20070625161555im_/http://www.pantspantspants.biz/top-original.jpg` can be assumed to be an image of some kind (but lets be a little careful with location based urls because the thing that's there could change)
* `twitter.com` can be assumed to mean whatever's at that link (aim for canonical urls)

Thots are by humans for humans. They are not facts. In fact, they're not even true. They're not our "digital exhaust". 

## Why would anyone use this?

IC is used to create meaning.  `.ic` is a way to store and share our thoughts on the web.  It's simpler and more straightforward than HTML because it serves a different purpose. 

These are not tools for influence. There is no reason to spam an IC because there is no central authority.  We can easily decide what to include or remove depending on what we're after.

There are only like a bazillion reasons, but for now you'll have think of them yourself ðŸ™ƒ


## Seeding (?)

Eventually we'll amass enormous collections of thots managed and curated by different groups for different reasons.  "Seeding" is an approach to interacting with these unweildy data sets.  When we seed we use a small collection of our own and pull in only the thots from the larger set that are explicitly mentioned in ours and their direct ancestors.
