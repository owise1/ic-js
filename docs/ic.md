At its essence, IC is about creating meaning by collecting our thoughts (well techincally our [thots](#Thots), but we'll get to that...)

The whole thing is built on an extremely simple and flexible protocol...

```
IC is
+ plain text
+ with a couple simple rules
- complicated
```
That's it. That's the whole idea. The preceding example demonstrates the fundamental concepts of  IC:

* When we encounter a text string formatted like so it represents a single perspective. If we found that in the wild we would assume it represented one person's perceptions.
* the first line- `IC is` - declares that this is the [thot](#Thots) we're about to describe. 
* lines that start with a `+` are like "yes".  In this case, this person thinks `IC is` *is* `plain text`, and from a certain perspective they're right. `+plain text` strengthens the connection between `IC is` and `plain text`. 
* a `-` at the beginning of the line is like a "no". `IC is` is "repelling" `complicated`
* notice that it's `IC is` not `IC` with some stiled tags. It's however I felt like saying it / however I ended up writing it and then I hit <enter>

The easiest way to think about it is like tagging. Only it's tagging everything, even the tags themselves. 

## Thots

Every new splooge of tech needs a dumb word and this is ours.  But this one is actually good because it sounds the same only spelled different.

`Thots` are just text, but you can think of them like a digital version of thoughts. They are our thoughts when we put them into a computer. Clearly something is lost, but it's ever so much more efficient. When viewed like so, you see that shorter `thots` will be used to tie huge numbers of things together, similar to how we use tags now.  But as `thots` get longer and/or more idiosyncratic, *and* as the collections of `thots` grow, they can be used to connect like minds, or maybe create them.

Because `thots` are just text *and* so much other stuff online is also just text, `thots` can also represent those online things. For example:

* `@owise1` can be assumed to be a social media handle of some kind. at least these days.
* `/ipfs/QmckHbjMQTww8UaruK8HMxGv9aMGyx2ynFggqg6wQqs19i` can be assumed to be a file of some kind
* `https://web.archive.org/web/20070625161555im_/http://www.pantspantspants.biz/top-original.jpg` can be assumed to be an image of some kind (but lets be a little careful with location based urls because the thing that's there could change)
* `twitter.com` can be assumed to mean whatever's at that link (aim for canonical urls)

Thots are by humans for humans. They are not facts. In fact, they're not even true. They're not our "digital exhaust". 

## Why would anyone use this?

There are only like a bazillion reasons, but for now you'll have think of them yourself ðŸ™ƒ
