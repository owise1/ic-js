IC is an extremely simple text format designed for creating meaning.  It's a simple way to collect, share, and connect our associations, perceptions, and thoughts with others.

The easiest way to think about `IC` is like tagging. Only you're tagging everything, even the tags themselves. And the tags don't have to be short, they can be any length. And the tags aren't siloed inside whatever platform you happen to be using. They're just "on the internet", so when you tag "tree", or "embarassing moments" it can be combined with everyone else's everywhere.

Or it's like an umbel. Clusters of meaning scattered through a meadow, and we're the kids collecting them for potions.

## Thots

Every new splooge of tech needs a dumb word and this is ours.  But don't worry, this one is actually good cuz it sounds the same but it's spelled different.

`Thots` are just text, but you can think of them like a digital version of thoughts. They are our thoughts when we put them into a computer. Clearly something is lost, but it's so much more *efficient*.  Shorter `thots` like "cool" and "brilliant" can be used to tie huge numbers of things together.  As `thots` get longer and/or more idiosyncratic, *and* as the collections of `thots` grow, they can be used to connect like minds, or maybe create new ones.

Because `thots` are just text *and* so much other stuff online is also just text, `thots` can also represent those online things. For example:

* `@owise1` can be assumed to be a social media handle of some kind. at least these days.
* `/ipfs/QmckHbjMQTww8UaruK8HMxGv9aMGyx2ynFggqg6wQqs19i` can be assumed to be a file of some kind
* `https://web.archive.org/web/20070625161555im_/http://www.pantspantspants.biz/top-original.jpg` can be assumed to be an image of some kind (but lets be a little careful with location based urls because the thing that's there could change)
* `twitter.com` can be assumed to mean whatever's at that link (aim for canonical urls)
* `0xed9bc30ffd85ace691fcbcd9487b37ca7818c072` a wallet address?

Thots are by humans for humans. They are not facts. In fact, they're not even true. They're not our "digital exhaust". 

Also, if it makes you more comfortable, you can just call them "tags". We're old.

## Perspectives

Perspectives are what tie thots together. A perspective says "this thing is like that thing", "that thot is not like this thot", "these thos seem related", or "that is definitely not that". A perspective strengthens a connection between two thots or it weakens the connection.

Let's try an example: "tree". When a lumberjack looks at a tree they may see it's genus, it's age, diameter, straightness, hardness, it's proximity to other trees, accessibility. When a gardener looks at a tree they may also think of it's genus, but also when it blooms, how big it gets, its habit, whether it's native to the area, whether it produces fruit. In some moments their thoughts overlap, in others they diverge.  As their experience grows their thoughts about trees grow more nuanced and idiosyncratic. Were the gardener and the lumberjack to meet we'd likely see some "cross-pollination" of their perspectives.

 I dont have a single perspective. If I am anything it is a collection of ever-shifting perspectives.  As I encounter new perspectives I can try them on and then take the parts that resonate.  This is how we treat perspectives in IC. They're "cheap": easy to create, incorporate, or discard. They are ubiquitous. Some perspectives are collections of other perspectives. We hold onto and build on the ones that have meaning for us or that are useful for certain purposes.

 ## IC Specification

 That's really all there is to it. We've got thots and we've got perspectives that connect them together.  That's really all we need to start building an entirely new way of using the internet.  If you are the techie sort you can [go here](/docs/ic-export.md) to read about the IC spec. Otherwise, continue onward...

## Why would anyone use this?

We can use ICs to create and discover meaning. I put down what I think. You put down what you think. Then we combine them in all the different ways.

`.ic` is a way to store and share our thoughts on the web.  It's simpler and more straightforward than HTML because it serves a different purpose. We can use it to build a universal database of human thought normalized on the way we speak. And we can use it to create dense meaning webs with closeknit groups.

These are tools for connection not influence. There is no reason to spam an IC because there is no central authority.  We can easily decide what to include or remove depending on what we're after. Our trusted collections are treasures. We protect them.

Plus, there are only like a bazillion other things you could do with an IC. Here are a few ideas...

### All The Types

What if you had a motivated group of Star Wars superfans describe all the characters in the franchise....

```
Darth Vader
+slightly torn, but mostly evil
+prone to overreactions
-cuddly
```

Then we created an online personality test where we presented the descriptions and had participants describe themselves.  Now we can show them the Star Wars character they're most like!  We can also easily combine their responses with Harry Potter fan lists or traditional psychological categories too.  It's all open and easy. All we need to know is the location of the sanctioned lists. We can also use ML clustering techniques to find connections between characters across literature. fun.

### Shadow reviews

A browser extension that creates a shadow review system on top of every e-commerce site.  It'd use the canonical url as the parent from which all associations/descriptions stemmed.  Individual `.ic` files would be published in public on ipfs and aggregated by the extension.  This system would have a number of benefits over the current review systems

* decentralized so they can't be controlled by the site owners
* reviews would be more in depth than the current "narrative" style because they could contain our impressions and feelings
* individual reviewers (perspectives) / review keywords (thots and the perspectives that used them) could be purged from your view to create a more personalized view
* easily surface reviews from your social networks


### Search

To get a taste of what the web has become, what we've all become accustomed to, search for a recipe on google.  Wade past Google's promoted links and the prepackaged results from services with the resources/[$$] motivations to build to google's idosyncratic recipe ingestion API, then click one of the results.  Now scroll past popups, video ads, commentary on how much the author's family loves this generations old secret recipe and you may find the recipe you started out wanting in the first place.

With IC I could easily start collecting links under "recipes" then combine mine with all my friends, or other trusted ICs. Add to that that we can tag each recipe with the ingredients, or thoughts about it, tips...and we'd have a simple, personalized, searchable recipe box.
 
 Or you do it with links and you've got a distributed del.icio.us with almost no effort.

 ### Conjuring The Big Brain That Ends Humanity

 Let's address the elephant in the room.  Are we about to unwittingly unleash the sentient machine that ends all human suffering by removing the source? I *kinda* doubt it, but it's probably worth considering.
