At its essence, IC is about creating meaning by collecting our thoughts (well techincally our [thots](#Thots), but we'll get to that...)

The whole thing is built on an extremely simple and flexible standard...

```
IC is
+ plain text
+ with a couple simple rules
- complicated
```
That's it. That's the whole idea. The preceding example demonstrates the fundamental concepts of  IC:

* When we encounter a text string formatted like so it represents a single perspective. If we found that in the wild we would assume it represented one person's perceptions.
* the first line- `IC is` - declares that this is the [thot](#Thots) we're about to describe. 
* lines that start with a `+` are like "yes".  In this case, this person thinks `IC is` *is* `plain text`, and from a certain perspective they're right. `+plain text` strengthens the connection between `IC is` and `plain text`. The connection is directional: `plain text` describes `IC is` or you could say that `plain text` is a child of `IC is`.
* a `-` at the beginning of the line is like a "no". `IC is` is "repelling" `complicated`
* notice that the initial thot is `IC is` not `IC`. It could have been with `IC` too, but it's important to keep s moment I chose to keep it more "natural". That's how I ended up writing it and then I hit <enter>. If I'd wanted to compete in/influence the mindspace for `IC` I might have used more strategy

tldr...The easiest way to think about IC is like tagging. Only ur tagging everything, even the tags themselves. 

## Thots

Every new splooge of tech needs a dumb word and this is ours.  But don't worry, this one is actually good cuz it sounds the same but it's spelled different.

`Thots` are just text, but you can think of them like a digital version of thoughts. They are our thoughts when we put them into a computer. Clearly something is lost, but it's so much more *efficient*. When viewed like so, you see that shorter `thots` will be used to tie huge numbers of things together, similar to how we use tags now, only in an open way without the silos.  As `thots` get longer and/or more idiosyncratic, *and* as the collections of `thots` grow, they can be used to connect like minds, or maybe create new ones.

Because `thots` are just text *and* so much other stuff online is also just text, `thots` can also represent those online things. For example:

* `@owise1` can be assumed to be a social media handle of some kind. at least these days.
* `/ipfs/QmckHbjMQTww8UaruK8HMxGv9aMGyx2ynFggqg6wQqs19i` can be assumed to be a file of some kind
* `https://web.archive.org/web/20070625161555im_/http://www.pantspantspants.biz/top-original.jpg` can be assumed to be an image of some kind (but lets be a little careful with location based urls because the thing that's there could change)
* `twitter.com` can be assumed to mean whatever's at that link (aim for canonical urls)

Thots are by humans for humans. They are not facts. In fact, they're not even true. They're not our "digital exhaust".

## Why would anyone use this?

IC is used to create meaning.  `.ic` is a way to store and share our thoughts on the web.  It's simpler and more straightforward than HTML because it serves a different purpose. 

These are not tools for influence. There is no reason to spam an IC because there is no central authority.  We can easily decide what to include or remove depending on what we're after.

There are only like a bazillion things you could do with IC. Here are a few ideas...

### All The Types

What if you had a motivated group of Star Wars superfans describe all the characters in the franchise....

```
Darth Vader
+slightly torn, but mostly evil
+prone to overreactions
-cuddly
```

Then we created an online personality test where we presented the descrptions and had participants describe themselves.  Now we can show them the Star Wars character they're most like!  We can also easily combine their responses with Harry Potter fan lists or traditional psychological categories too.  It's all open and easy. All we need to know if the location of the sanctioned lists. We can also use ML clustering techniques to find connections between characters across literature.

### Shadow reviews

A browser extension that creates a shadow review system on top of every e-commerce site.  It'd use the canonical url as the parent from which all associations/descriptions stemmed.  Individual `.ic` files would be published in public on ipfs and aggregated by the extension.  This system would have a number of benefits over the current review systems

* decentralized so they can't be controlled by the site owners
* reviews would be more in depth than the current "narrative" style 
* individual reviewers (perspectives) / review keywords (thots and the perspectives that used them) could be purged from your view to create a more personalized view
* easily surface reviews from your social networks
