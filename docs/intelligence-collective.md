At its essence, IC is about creating meaning by collecting our thoughts (well techincally our [thots](#Thots), but we'll get to that...)

The whole thing is built on an extremely simple and flexible protocol...

```
IC is
+plain text
-complicated
```

Although it's simple, the above example demonstrates the fundamental concepts of  IC:

* by default each .ic file or text snippet represents a single perspective. If we found the preceding text in the wild we would assume it represented one person's perceptions.
* the first line- `IC is` - declares that this is the [thot](#Thots) we're about to describe. 
* lines that start with a `+` are like "yes".  In this case, this person thinks `IC is` *is* `plain text`, and from a certain perspective they're right. `+plain text` strengthens the connection between `IC is` and `plain text`. 
* a `-` at the beginning of the line is like a "no". `IC is` is "repelling" `complicated`

The easiest way to think about it is like tagging. We're kinda tagging `IC is` with `plain text` and `not complicated`.  But it's also not quite tagging.

## Thots

`Thots` are just text, but you can think of them like a digital version of thoughts. They are our thoughts when we put them into a computer. Clearly something is lost, but it's ever so much more efficient. When viewed like so, you see that shorter `thots` will be used to tie huge numbers of things together, similar to how we use tags now.  But as `thots` get longer and/or more idiosyncratic they can be used to connect with like minds. 

Because `thots` are just text *and* so much other stuff online is also just text, `thots` can also represent those online things. For example:

* `@owise1` can be assumed to be a social media handle of some kind
* `/ipfs/QmckHbjMQTww8UaruK8HMxGv9aMGyx2ynFggqg6wQqs19i` can be assumed to be a file of some kind
* `https://web.archive.org/web/20070625161555im_/http://www.pantspantspants.biz/top-original.jpg` can be assumed to be an image of some kind (but lets be a little careful with location based urls because the thing that's there could change)
* `twitter.com` can be assumed to mean whatever's at that link (aim for canonical urls)


## Why would anyone use this?

There are only like a bazillion reasons, but for now you'll have think of them yourself ðŸ™ƒ
