In its essence, IC is about creating meaning by tying together our thoughts (well techincally our [thots](#Thots), but we'll get to that...)

It is built on an extremely simple and flexible protocol...

```
IC is
+plain text
-complicated
```

Although it's simple, the above example demonstrates the fundamental concepts of  IC:

* by default each .ic file or text snippet represents a single perspective. If we found the preceding text in the wild we would assume it represented one person's perceptions.
* the first line- "IC is" - says this is the [thot](#Thots) we're about to decribe. 
* lines that start with a `+` are like "yes". `+plain text` strengthens the connection between "IC is" and "plain text". In this case, this person thinks "IC is" is "plain text" and from a certain perspective they're right 
* a `-` at the beginning of the line is like a "no". "IC is" is repelling "complicated"

The easiest way to think about it is like tagging. We're sorta tagging "IC is" with "plain text" and "not complicated".  But it's also not quite tagging.

## Thots

`Thots` are just text, but you can think of them like a digital version of thoughts. They are our thoughts when we put them into a computer. When you look at them like that, you see that shorter `thots` will be used to tie huge numbers of things together, similar to how we use tags now.  But as `thots` get longer and/or more idiosyncratic they can be used to connect with like minds. 

Because `thots` are just text and so much other stuff online is also just text `thots` can also represent those online things. For example:

* `@owise1` can be assumed to be a social media handle of some kind
* `/ipfs/QmckHbjMQTww8UaruK8HMxGv9aMGyx2ynFggqg6wQqs19i` can be assumed to be a file of some kind
* `https://web.archive.org/web/20070625161555im_/http://www.pantspantspants.biz/top-original.jpg` can be assumed to be an image of some kind (but lets be a little careful with location based urls because the thing that's there could change)
* `http://twitter.com` can be assumed to mean a website 


## Why would anyone use this?

There are only like a bazillion reasons, but for now you'll have think of them yourself ðŸ™ƒ
