# Privacy and IC

Our personal thoughts and connections are *extremely* valuable and precious.  At the same time, meaning is created collectively.  A central goal of IC is giving us control over our data.

## No "People" / No universal user IDs 

Mark Zuckerberg made a deal with the devil the moment he decided to connect online profiles with actual people. IC is not about "people" but about "perspectives". We change depending on our context. We are a collection of perspectives. When we share our perspective with the world we do so as anonymously possible. By default, `.ic` format files are posted without dIds. Individuals need to keep track of their perspectives/perspectives they identify with by saving their links. 

A couple useful conventions would be:
* Avoid entering personal data or really any facts at all. IC is about what we think, not what is true.
* Aim to keep perspectives small. IC makes it easy combine many small pieces

## Can I be tracked?

IC is built on top of IPFS and is not encrypted. This makes it so we can share and benefit from each other's ideas easily. Your IC groups live in your browser or on your server so it is possible that your IP could be tracked if someone was so inclined.  A VPN could help with that.
